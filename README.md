### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a PhD student at UCSD, engaged in research on the XENONnT particle physics experiment.

Beyond my contributions to maintaining and developing data analysis repositories for XENONnT, I work on open-source medical imaging simulations and physics-informed machine learning. 

Additionally, I apply my coding and mathematical knowledge to board game design as a creative and technical hobby.
